            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>If you're making a frittata, as we did in our <a href="frittata.html">Frittata Recipe</a>, it's great to have a side to go along with it.
                    I usually use potatoes as my side dish for breakfast. I could do this from scratch, but I'm feeling lazy today so I'm just going to go with a frozen bag of potatoes.
                </p>
