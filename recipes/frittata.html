            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Frittata makes for a great breakfast, especially when you have a group to feed! 
                    Frittatas are simple to make - all you need is a few vegetables, eggs, milk (or a substitute), spices/seasonings and a pan. 
                    You start by sautéing the vegetables, then add in the egg mixture, and finally just bake it.
                </p>
                <p>In total, it'll take about an hour to make a frittata. You'll need time to prep and sauté the vegetables, let the egg mixture cook a little on the stove, and then about 30 minutes of baking time. 
                    When I make frittatas, I put hot sauce on top and serve alongside some hash browns. Enjoy the recipe!

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a 9-inch oven-safe pan on medium heat and add oil, and preheat your oven to 425F</li>
                    <li>Mix the eggs and milk (or substitute) into a pouring cup, and whip until thoroughly mixed. Set aside</li>
                    <li>Sauté onions until soft and translucent. Adding salt and sugar makes the onions taste great</li>
                    <li>When the onions are almost done, add the garlic and toss for a couple of minutes</li>
                    <li>Add the sweet potato and broccoli, and cover for a few minutes until the sweet potato is soft. Stir occasionally</li>
                    <li>Finally, add the tomatoes and spinach. Cover again to steam the spinach and cook down. Stir occasionally</li>
                    <li>Add the rest of your seasonings to the pan, stir and cook</li>
                    <li>When the vegetables are cooked to your liking, add in the egg mixture. Pour evenly and tilt the pan to ensure even coverage</li>
                    <li>Turn the stove off, but leave the pan on the range for 3-5 minutes to lightly cook the egg</li>
                    <li>Place the pan in the oven and bake for roughly 8-10 minutes</li>
                    <li>Check occassionally, by sticking a fork in the frittata. If the fork comes out wet, keep cooking. Stop cooking when the fork comes out clean</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Cut into pie slices, let cool and enjoy!</p>
