# odin-recipes
First HTML project in TOP.
This project will put together all of the basic HTML knowledge I have to date to build a basic recipe website. It will basically be a main index page with links to a few different recipes.

At the end of this project, here is what I learned and/or did all by myself:
I built some muscle memory in writing HTML boilerplate and using the command line interface. I used the command line interface for all file/directory actions, without using the UI except to open files in Visual Studio bc my "code" command needs to be re-turned on every time I open Terminal...

I got comfortable working with links and images, as well as lists in HTML.

I learned how to resize some images, though I hardcoded the dimensions and I'm not sure if there's a better way to do that.

I committed early and often, and worked on writing concise commit messages.

I learned how tedious building pages from scratch can be. But, I had fun!
